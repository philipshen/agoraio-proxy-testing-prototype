Status: WIP

This is a test environment to help us learn more about proxy, firewall, and VPN interactions with Agora. It's a WIP.

A few goals:

- Analyze IP addresses used by Agora for various services, and detect when this changes via SDK versions
- Help us test our proxy handling behavior faster
- If we manage to consistently repro an issue, we can send the LayerCI link for this project to Agora to help things move faster
